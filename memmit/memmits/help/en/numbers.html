        Memorizing large numbers or sequences of digits is not as hard as it seems.
        If you try to do it head on, you'll probably find that you can't remember
        more than 7-20 digits at a time, but there is an easier
        and more efficient approach.

        Our brain is more comfortable with remembering images or objects
        than abstract numeric data. Because of this, memorizing numbers
        usually comes down to creating a sequence of images or a story,
        each element of which corresponds to one or more digits.
